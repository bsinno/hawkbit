== GET /{tenant}/controller/v1/{controllerid}

=== Implementation notes

This base resource can be regularly polled by the controller on the provisioning target or device in order to retrieve actions that need to be executed. Those are provided as a list of links to give more detailed information about the action. Links are only available for initial configuration or open actions, respectively. The resource supports Etag based modification checks in order to save traffic. Note: deployments have to be confirmed in order to move on to the next action. Cancellations have to be confirmed or rejected.

== GET /{tenant}/controller/v1/{controllerid}/cancelAction/{actionId}

=== Implementation notes

The SP server might cancel an operation, e.g. an unfinished update has a sucessor. It is up to the provisiong target to decide to accept the cancelation or reject it.

== POST /{tenant}/controller/v1/{controllerid}/cancelAction/{actionId}/feedback

=== Implementation notes

It is up to the device how much intermediate feedback is provided. However, the action will be kept open until the controller on the device reports a finished (either successful or error) or rejects the action, e.g. the canceled actions have been started already.

== PUT /{tenant}/controller/v1/{controllerid}/configData

=== Implementation notes

The usual behaviour is that when a new device resgisters at the server it is requested to provide the meta information that will allow the server to identify the device on a hardware level (e.g. hardware revision, mac address, serial number etc.).

=== Response to a requested metadata pull from the provisioning target device.

== GET /{tenant}/controller/v1/{controllerid}/deploymentBase/{actionId}

=== Implementation notes

Core resource for deployment operations. Contains all information necessary in order to execute the operation. 

Keep in mind that the provided download links for the artifacts are generated dynamically by the update server. Host, port and path and not guaranteed to be similar to the provided examples below but will be defined at runtime.

=== Deployment or update action

==== Curl

include::{snippets}/rootcontroller/get-controller-basedeployment-action/curl-request.adoc[]

==== Request URL

include::{snippets}/rootcontroller/get-controller-basedeployment-action/http-request.adoc[]

==== Request path parameter

include::{snippets}/rootcontroller/get-controller-basedeployment-action/path-parameters.adoc[]

==== Request query parameter

include::{snippets}/rootcontroller/get-controller-basedeployment-action/request-parameters.adoc[]

=== Response (Status 200)

==== Response fields

include::{snippets}/rootcontroller/get-controller-basedeployment-action/response-fields.adoc[]

==== Response example

In this case the (optional) query for the last 10 messages, previously provided by the device, are included. Useful if the devices provide state information previously on the feedback channel and won't store it locally.

=== Response (Status 200) with a maintenance window defined but not active yet

In addition to the straight forward approach to inform the device to download and install the software in one transaction hawkBit supports the separation of download and installation into separate steps.

This feature is called Maintenance Window where the device is informed to download the software first and then when it enters a defined (maintenance) window the installation triggers follows as in the example above.

==== Response example

Note: artifact details not shown in this example.
